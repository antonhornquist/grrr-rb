	grrr-rb

SYNOPSIS

	UI library for grid based controllers

DESCRIPTION

	This is a port of my SuperCollider project grrr-sc to ruby targeting the jruby platform. It requires scext-rb. The ruby version primarily exists since i wanted to run test suites from the command prompt. For real-time performances use grrr-sc.

	# Example 1

	a = ScreenGrid.new

	b = GridButton.new(a, "0@0")
	b.action = lambda { |value| puts "the first button's value was changed to #{value}!" }

	c = GridButton.new_momentary(a, "1@1", 2, 2)
	c.action = lambda { |value| puts "the second button's value was changed to #{value}!" }

	a.remove_all

	# Example 2

	b = GridButton.new_decoupled(a, "0@0")
	b.button_pressed_action = lambda { puts "the first button was pressed!" }
	b.button_released_action = lambda { puts "the first button was released!" }
